#this is a simple html,css ,javaScript project that uses mp3 sounds files that are made clickable so that you can have a sound board on click.

#It shows the basics of adding sound to a html document and controlling the sound by means of
java Script and its event handlers to give that dynamic aspec instead of the static that is
given by html

#The css is used for the styleing of the project

#Git using the basic commands to commit and add files to my repository
